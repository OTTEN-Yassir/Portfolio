## About The Event
As a volunteer and representative of my school at the (ULB)Free University of Brussels' Spring Science event, I had the privilege of manning our stand, engaging with attendees, and delving into discussions about technology and IT. It was an enriching experience to interact with individuals keen on exploring the advancements in these fields and to share insights into what our schooln (ESI HE2B) offers. From explaining the latest technological innovations to discussing the various programs and opportunities available at our institution, I found great satisfaction in being a part of such an informative and inspiring event.
