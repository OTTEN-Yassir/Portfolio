				<div class="content">
					<p>As a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Networks and Telecommunications at the Ecole Sup√©rieur d'Informatique (ESI) within the Haute Ecole Bruxelles-Brabant (HE2B) group, I am passionate about all fields of IT. My academic journey has equipped me with extensive knowledge and skills in network administration, configuration, and security, as well as in DevSecOps practices.</p>
					<p>My expertise spans network administration and security, with practical experience in using firewalls such as ASA, Juniper, Palo-Alto, and iptables. Additionally, I have developed strong proficiency in management methodologies like INFOSEC and Agile practices. My curiosity has driven me to explore various aspects of IT, including cybersecurity, networking, and DevSecOps.</p>
					<p>I also possess comprehensive skills in full stack programming, having worked with various technologies and frameworks to develop robust and scalable applications. This includes front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies such as Laravel, Java , C++, and databases like SQL and NoSQL.</p>
					<p>Looking ahead, I am eager to further my education and career in IT, leveraging my academic foundation and practical experience to make meaningful contributions. With a proactive approach to learning and a commitment to excellence, I am determined to continue growing and making a lasting impact in the field of information technology.</p>
